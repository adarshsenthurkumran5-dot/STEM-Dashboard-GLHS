RESEARCH PLAN

Title:  Examining the Impact of Manic-Like Defendant Behavior on
        Juror Perception and Decision-Making in Simulated Trials

Research Question:
  Does manic-like defendant behavior in a simulated trial significantly
  affect mock jurors' verdicts, credibility ratings, and sentencing
  recommendations compared to a neutral behavioral presentation?

Hypothesis:
  Mock jurors exposed to manic-like defendant behavior will assign
  higher culpability and harsher sentences than those observing neutral
  behavior, independent of the evidence presented.

Variables:
  Independent:  Defendant behavior condition (manic-like vs. neutral)
  Dependent:    Verdict, sentencing severity (1–10), credibility (Likert 1–7)
  Controlled:   Case facts, evidence, juror demographics, script length

Methodology:
  n=60 adults via convenience sampling. Group A (n=30): manic-like
  transcript. Group B (n=30): neutral delivery, identical content.
  All participants complete anonymous post-trial questionnaire.
  Informed consent obtained prior to participation.

Data Analysis:
  Independent-samples t-tests, chi-square for categorical outcomes,
  Cohen's d for effect size. Significance threshold: p < 0.05.
